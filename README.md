Welcome to this simple account ledger webapp, which has been created using create-react-app

This app has been developed using node version 14.15.1 and npm version 6.14.9 and the source code has been uploaded to github

Please check your own version numbers for compatibility if experiencing any difficulties building / running the application

Let's get started by cloning the code onto your machine and running the webapp:

1. Navigate to your desired folder directory for source code (e.g. C:\Source\)
2. Open up a command prompt / terminal and run git clone "https://github.com/MatthewDKemp/account-ledger"
3. Navigate inside the 'account-ledger' folder and run the following 2 commands in the order specified:
    a) npm i
    b) npm start
4. The web page will open automatically in your default browser. If needed, it can be accessed again at http://localhost:3000
5. Enjoy some simple transaction logging and balance checking :)

Some simple unit tests have been developed using jest, these can be run by executing the following from the project directory:  'npm run test'
